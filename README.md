# Detect-sheep-in-an-video-using-Tensorflow-API

This is a google colab implementation for doing sheep detection inference on a video. 

##Model
This repository is distributed with the 'ssd_resnet50_v1_fpn_640x640_coco17_tpu-8' model that is suited for fast and lightweight inference but may not be as accurate as the more larger models. If you want to try something else, you can get another coco-trained model from [the model-zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md)
