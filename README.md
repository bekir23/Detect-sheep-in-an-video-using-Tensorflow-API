# Detect-sheep-in-an-video-using-Tensorflow-API

This is a google colab project for doing sheep detection inference on a video. 

## Model
This repository is distributed with the 'ssd_resnet50_v1_fpn_640x640_coco17_tpu-8' model that is suited for fast and lightweight inference but may not be as accurate as the more larger models. If you want to try something else, you can get another coco-trained model from [the model-zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md)

## Usage
This code is not full implementation. You need to download this repository and upload to "/content/gdrive/My Drive" that is in your google drive.
After that you need to follow the steps in Sheep_Detection.ipynb
